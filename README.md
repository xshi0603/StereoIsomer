**Overview:**

Our project is essentially a recreation of the cookie clicker game where you have a giant cookie on the left hand side of the screen that the user can click to obtain cookies. Using a certain number of cookies, the user can buy generators which will help them generate cookies automatically on specified time intervals. In addition, they can upgrade their generators to produce more cookies or upgrade their click value to produce more cookies per click. There will be a leaderboard based off of how many cookies each player has. This means that users must create an account, which keeps track of cookies made.

**Instructions:**

First, clone the repo locally. You will need python, flask, and requests in order to run this app, which is also explained in the dependencies section. Once all dependencies are set up, you can  launch the website on localhost by running the command:

```
$ python app.py
```

To view the website, navigate to localhost:5000 in your browser. Make an account by following the register link on the home page. After making an account and logging in, you will be redirected to the gaming page. From here, you can click the cookie to earn revenue and buy generators to produce cookies for you. You will also be able to upgrade many aspects. Click away! (Don't forget to save!)
